/* 

Hint 1:
To listen for keyboard events, hook a "keydown" event listener onto
the `box` element. To figure out which key the user has pressed, use the
event.keyCode property in the callback funtion

Like this:
box.addEventListener("keydown", function(evt) {
    console.log("keydown: " + evt.keyCode)
})

Hint 2:
To set the content of the text element to an emoji, do the following:
text.textContent = "ðŸ˜Ž"
