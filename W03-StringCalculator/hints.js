/* 
Hint 1:
    To parse the equation, you can use the "split" method 
    on the equation string to break it up 
    into an array of its components

    Like this:
        let equationString = "3 * 5"
        equationString.split(" ") -> ["3", "*", "5"]
    
Hint 2:
    A switch statement or a chain of if/else statements 
    can help you evaluate which operation to do 
    based on the equation's operator: +, -, *, or / 
    
Hint 3: 
    You can use the built in `parseInt()` to parse a string
    containing an integer value into an integer
    
    Like this:
        let myValue = "42"
        parseInt(myValue) -> 42

Hint 4:
    Row-based Flexbox:
        Horizontal Alignment: `justify-content`
        Vertical Alignment: `align-items`
    
    Column-based Flexbox
        Horizontal Alignment: `align-items`
        Vertical Alignment: `justify-content`
