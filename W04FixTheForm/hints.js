PART 1: 

First, head over to https://www.color-hex.com/color-palettes/ and find a color palette you like.
Try to experiment with using the various colors of the palette as the background 
and the color property of the elements on the site (h3, button, input). 

Notice that all there's no space between the left edge of the website and the elements. Give the
elements some breathing room. This can be done with e.g. setting a padding on the body,
or by centering the elements on the page using flexbox. Here's how to do it with flexbox:

form {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

Also, it should be some vertical breathing room as well. Feel free
to use margins for this, e.g:

input {
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

You should also make the button and input match. Notice that their border-radius' are
different. This needs to be fixed.

Want to improve the button animation? Try adding this to button:hover, and see what happens:
    
    transition: font-size 0.1s ease-in-out;
